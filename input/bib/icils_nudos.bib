  abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to examine the interaction effects of gender and motivational beliefs on students' self-regulated learning. Specifically, three types of motivational beliefs under the Expectancy-Value Model were examined, namely self-efficacy, control beliefs and anxiety. Methodology: A quantitative correlational research design was used to achieve the research objectives. Data were collected through the questionnaire survey method from 322 secondary school students (166 males; 156 females). The samples were taken from two ICT-integrated schools located in Peninsular Malaysia. The learning environment in these schools was conducive for self-regulated learning. The Learning Strategies Scale and the Motivation Scale, taken from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) were used to measure the variables of the study. Findings: The findings showed that self-efficacy and control beliefs were positively related to students' self-regulated learning. Anxiety, however, was found to be negatively related to self-regulated learning. The interactions between gender and levels of motivational beliefs on self-regulated learning were also explored in this study. The relationships between self-efficacy and self-regulated learning differed according to gender. However, there were no significant interaction effects between gender and internal control beliefs on self-regulated learning. This implies that gender differences in self-regulated learning were not due to the differences in control beliefs and anxiety. Significance: This study offers insights on the interaction effects between motivational beliefs, and gender and self-regulated learning. It may help to develop effective instructional strategies to enhance students' self-regulated learning skill in ICT-related learning environments.},

  abstract = {In the past, several studies have investigated the relationship between gender and socioeconomic status on the one hand, and students' ICT competences on the other. In this research field, two problems seem to occur. First, research findings are inconclusive. Second, most studies are conducted from the perspective of self-perceived ICT competence. Such measures suffer from self-reported bias, as they depend on students' own judgment of their ICT competences. This study aims to tackle both these problems. First, the outline of the design of a computer and performance-based assessment test that measures primary school students' ICT competences in a direct and valid way is presented. Second, the relationship between gender and socioeconomic status, and the students' results on the test i.e. their actual ICT competences was investigated. The performance-based test was administered to a representative sample of 378 sixth-grade students of 58 primary schools. The results of this study indicate that primary school students in general have particular difficulties in higher-order ICT competences that focus on communicating in a socially acceptable and clearly understandable way. Moreover, results show that girls have better technical ICT skills and higher-order ICT competences than boys. With regard to socioeconomic status, results show that the educational level of the mother is positively related to both students' technical ICT skills and higher-order ICT competences.},

En el pasado, varios estudios han investigado la relaci{\'o}n entre el g{\'e}nero y el nivel socioecon{\'o}mico por un lado, y las competencias tic de los estudiantes por otro. Durante estos estudios han aparecido dos problemas: los hallazgos son inconclusos y que la mayor{\'i}a de las evaluaciones tic se han hecho desde la misma perspectiva del estudiante, por lo cual contienen un sesgo autoinformado. El siguiente texto tiene como objetivo abordar ambos problemas, en primer caso midiendo de manera directa las competencias tic de estudiantes de primaria e investigando la relaci{\'o}n entre el g{\'e}nero y el nivel socioecon{\'o}mico adem{\'a}s de los resultados de los estudiantes en las pruebas, es decir, sus competencias reales en las tic. La prueba tuvo una muestra representativa de 378 estudiantes de sexto grado de 58 escuelas primarias. Los resultados indican que en general, los estudiantes de primaria tienen dificultades particulares en competencia tic de nivel superior, que se centran en comunicar de manera socialmente aceptable y claramente comprensible. Adem{\'a}s se constata que las ni{\~n}as tienen mejores habilidades tecnicas en tic que los ni{\~n}os. En cuanto al nivel socioecon{\'o}mico, los resultados demuestran que el nivel educativo de la madre est{\'a} relacionado positivamente con las habilidades tic de los estudiantes.\\
\\
En estudios anteriores se han desarrollado y utilizado varios instrumentos de autoinforme para medir determinados aspectos de las competencias TIC de los alumnos o las competencias TIC de los alumnos en general, como la escala de autoeficacia general en Internet (GISE) y la escala de autoeficacia comunicativa en Internet (CISE) de Liang y Tsai (2008), o la escala de exploraci{\'o}n en l{\'i}nea y comunicaci{\'o}n en l{\'i}nea de Tsai y Tsai (2010). Torkzadeh y Van Dyke (2002) han operacionalizado la autoeficacia en Internet como la confianza de los estudiantes en la navegaci{\'o}n, la manipulaci{\'o}n del sistema y el cifrado/descifrado. La escala Computer-Email-Web Fluency de Bunz (2004) mide la capacidad autopercibida de los alumnos en el uso general del ordenador, el uso del correo electr{\'o}nico, la navegaci{\'o}n por la Web y la edici{\'o}n Web.\\
\\
Principalmente se rescata de este texto, que a la hora de medir el uso de Tic en estudiantes, es importante tener primero en cuenta, que tipos de estudios se realizaron, si fueron respuestas propias de los estudiantes, o si fueron pruebas aplicadas al manejo de las tic de los estudiantes, siendo est{\'a} {\'u}ltima lo recomendado por el texto, ya que eliminar{\'i}a los sesgos autoinformados. Por otra parte, tomando en cuenta resultados anteriores, el estudio recomienda tomar en cuenta como variables el g{\'e}nero (ya que la literatura revela que las ni{\~n}as tienen mejor rendimiento que ni{\~n}os (ejm ver ICILS CHILE2018) y grupo socioecon{\'o}mico.}

  abstract = {The concept of computer self-efficacy (CSE) recently has been proposed as important to the study of individual behavior toward information technology. This paper extends current understanding about the concept of self-efficacy in the context of computer software. We describe how two broad types of computer self-efficacy beliefs, general self-efficacy and task-specific self-efficacy, are constructed across different computing tasks by suggesting that initial general CSE beliefs will strongly predict subsequent specific CSE beliefs. The theorized causal relationships illustrate the malleability and development of CSE beliefs over time, within a training environment where individuals are progressively provided with greater opportunity for hands-on experience and practice with different software. Consistent with the findings of prior research, judgments of self-efficacy then serve as key antecedents of the perceived cognitive effort (ease of use) associated with technology usage. Further, we theorize that self-efficacy judgments in the task domain of computing are strongly influenced by the extent to which individuals believe that they are personally innovative with respect to information technology. Panel data were collected using a longitudinal research design within a training context where 186 subjects were taught two software packages in a sequential manner over a 14-week period. The emergent patterns of the hypothesized relationships are examined using structural equation modeling techniques. Results largely support the relationships posited.},

Nonetheless, certain social-cognitive processes involved in role modeling tend to be overlooked. This oversight is puzzling given that these processes, such as retention and reproduction of modeled behavior, are of great importance to role modeling processes---the consideration and inclusion of such processes can provide crucial insight. This paper provides an overview of the role model research in education to date, detailing researchers' focus and emphasis on identifying aspects of role model effectiveness. We then analyze how including the component processes of social learning or observational theory can add value and application to advance role modeling research. Finally, we provide recommendations to close the gap between current research trends and what has been previously theorized on modeling to help inform ongoing future investigations.

This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

  abstract = {For many years, researchers studied executive functions (EFs) in the laboratory with a focus on understanding an individual child's development and brain processes in a controlled environment. Building on this foundational research, there is a growing interest in EFs in the context of a child's dynamic, social world, and the contextual and compositional factors influencing EF development. This paper provides a descriptive view of EFs in 1112 K-3 children from six schools in Phoenix, AZ, USA. The study's goals were to examine (1) variation in EF scores between and within schools and classrooms, (2) predictors of variation in children's spring EF scores, and (3) individual and compositional predictors of children's spring EF scores. Our findings indicate greater variation in children's EF within schools than between, with very little or no variation arising from differences between schools. Though we observed greater variation within classrooms than between them, a notable amount of variance in children's spring EF scores appears to arise from differences between classrooms. Classroom-level variables, including a fall leave-out classroom mean (without the students' own score) and the number of children in the top or bottom grade-level quartiles in each classroom, were significant predictors of variation in spring EF scores as well as in fall to spring changes in EF. In some cases, the classroom variables were stronger predictors than individual fall scores. Findings suggest that understanding variation and cultivating growth in EF skills requires intervention, measurement, and analytic approaches that extend beyond the individual to include compositional features of the classroom environment. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Variation in children's EF scores (n~=~1112 children) was greater within schools (n~=~6 schools) than between, with very little or no variance arising from differences between schools. While variance was greater within classrooms than between (n~=~67 classrooms), a notable amount of variance in children's spring EF scores appears to arise from differences between classrooms. Classroom-level variables (e.g., leave-out mean, number of children in the top or bottom grade-level quartiles in each classroom) were significant predictors of variation and of changes in spring EF outcomes. In some cases, the classroom variables were stronger predictors of spring EF than individual fall scores.},

Data from 1319 American first-year college students (872 female and 447 male) indicate that gender differences in computer self-efficacy, stereotypes, interests, values, interpersonal orientation, and personality exist. If students had had a positive experience in their first CS course, they had a stronger intention to take another CS course. A subset of 128 students (68 females and 60 males) took a CS course up to one year later. Students who were interested in CS, had high computer self-efficacy, were low in family orientation, low in conscientiousness, and low in openness to experiences were more likely to take CS courses. Furthermore, individuals who were highly conscientious and low in relational-interdependent self-construal earned the highest CS grades. Efforts to improve women's representation in CS should bear these results in mind.},

  abstract = {With the rapid progress of technological development, self-efficacy in reference to digital devices (i.e., information and computer technology [ICT] self-efficacy) is an important driver that helps students to deal with technological problems and support their lifelong learning processes. Schools, peers, and home learning environments are important sources for the development of positive self-efficacy. Expanding on previous research, we investigated the associations between different aspects of the digital home learning environment and students' ICT self-efficacy. The moderation effects of gender were also tested. A total of 651 children answered a questionnaire about different digital home learning environment dimensions and estimated their ICT self-efficacy using an adapted scale---Schwarzer and Jerusalem's (1999) general self-efficacy scale. Using the structural equation modeling technique, a digital home learning environment containing six different qualities of parental support was investigated. Families' cultural capital, parents' attitudes toward the Internet, and shared Internet activities at home contributed positively to ICT self-efficacy. We observed small gender differences, with the moderation effect being nonsignificant. The results help researchers and practitioners to understand how different dimensions of the digital home learning environment support ICT self-efficacy. We will discuss how parents can enhance the home learning environment and how teachers can integrate this knowledge into formal education.},

  abstract = {Most research on the digital divide has focused on its socio-demographic correlates. Results indicate that age, gender and education, in particular, are major factors structuring the digital divide. So pervasive is the presence of age differences in the literature that many observers believe that the digital divide is basically a generational phenomenon that, in time, will disappear as younger computer literate cohorts replace older non-users. However, some researchers call this assumption into question. Moreover, the dominant focus on socio-demographics has led to a relative neglect of psychological factors as possible explanations for differential adoption and use of ICT. Consequently, the present study employs the social cognitive and self-efficacy theories of Bandura (1986, 1997) and the locus of control construct of Rotter (1966) in order to investigate some psychological correlates of the digital divide among a representative sample of Flemish adolescents (n=1145). The results indicate that computer locus of control and ICT self-efficacy supplement socio-demographic explanations of the digital divide. The results, however, are gender specific, indicating that there are different processes operating for males and females.}

This experience is measured by period of time using a computer and self-perceived computer and Internet experience. Further analyses on the impact of gender on this correlation of ICT experience and ICT attitudes were conducted by means of a multivariate model. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of gender, computer use, and self-perceived computer experience on computer anxiety attitudes, as well as several significant interaction effects. Males were found to have less computer anxiety than females; respondents who have used computers for a longer period of time and respondents with a higher self-perception of experience also show less computer anxiety. However, the GLM plot shows that the influence of computer experience works in different ways for males and females. Computer experience has a positive impact on decreasing computer anxiety for men, but a similar effect was not found for women. The model was also tested for computer liking and Internet-liking factors.}

This reflects  the importance of digital capital as an aspect of learner disadvantage (Park, 2017) and increased understanding of intersectional disadvantage (Nichols and Stahl, 2019), through which digital disadvantage may add to pre-existing inequalities. The Quality Assurance Agency (2020) report how  institutional action against digital poverty correlates with greater student satisfaction and higher levels of attainment. This article synthesises data from the authors' scholarship into digital barriers facing adult students returning to education. Challenges in relation to disposable income  often compound challenges intersecting with other aspects of disadvantage (Butcher and Rose-Adams, 2015), and a lack of confidence and inadequate digital readiness amongst learners from disadvantaged backgrounds seeking an Access entry route has been identified (Curry and Butcher, 2020; Fowle  and Butcher, 2019; Butcher and Fowle, 2018). Recommendations are made to promote greater inclusion amongst students from poor socio-economic backgrounds and to support the progression of a more diverse (and representative) adult learner cohort.},

The last meta-analysis on this issue covered the empirical studies up to about 20 years ago. Since then, technology use has increased exponentially, and many more empirical studies have examined this issue, but showed inconsistent findings. As a result, there is a lack of clear understanding about if such gender difference still persists. The purpose of this research is to re-examine this issue by meta-analyzing the empirical research studies on this issue in the last two decades, and to examine the potential moderators that may have contributed to the heterogeneity of the research findings. A total of 50 articles from 1997 to 2014 were identified and used in this meta-analysis. The findings indicated that males still hold more favorable attitudes toward technology use than females, but such different would be characterized as small effect sizes. The comparison between this study and the last meta-analysis of about two decades ago suggested that there was only minimal reduction in the gender attitudinal gap in general. But when the general attitude was broken down to different dimensions of attitude, the present study showed a reduction of gender difference in the dimension of Affect and Self-efficacy, but not in the dimension of Belief. The limitations of the study were noted, and the implications and future research directions were discussed.},
  keywords = {Attitude,Gender difference,Meta-analysis,Self-efficacy,Technology use},
  annotation = {The paper is a synthesis of quantitative reasearch about gender attitudes of technology use. This because the authors see that there's inconsistent results about this theme, so it's necesary to resume all the findings.\\
\\
To say something about tendencies of change in attitudinal gender technology issue: "As shown in the synthesis by Whitley (1997), despite the inconsistencies among the individual studies, the research findings generally suggested that males showed more favorable attitudes toward technology use than females, confirming the general perception that gender differences existed with regard to technology use. Such gender difference might partially explain the gender gap in technology use and in the technology workforce. This observation and conclusion, however, may not remain valid after almost two decades, during which the society has witnessed the fast development and wide use of technology in all aspects of the society. As Tsai and Lin (2004) discussed, with the increasing ubiquity of technology and its prominence, changes related to technology use could have occurred; with more females acquiring more experiences related to technology, gender differences regarding technology use, including the attitudes toward technology use, could have been narrowing over the years."\\
\\
Definition of attitude and classification: "In general, ``attitudes'' could be defined as ``people's global evaluations of any object, such as oneself, other people, possessions, issues, abstract concepts, and so forth'' (Petty, Fabrigar, \& Wegener, 2003, p.752), and such ``global evaluation'' may consist of different facets: affect (Emotional), beliefs (Cognitive), and self-efficacy (Behavourial capability) (Whitley, 1997).\\
\\
Definition of techonolical self-efficacy: "``Self-efficacy'' is generally known as the ``generative capability in which cognitive, social and behavioral sub-skills must be organized into integrated courses of action to serve innumerable purpose'' (Bandura, 1982). In terms of technology use, ``self-efficacy'' refers to peoples' belief in their own abilities to undertake a technology-related task successfully (McDonald \& Siegall, 1992)."\\
\\
Literature revision divide on this three dimensions\\
\\
Affective:\\
- greater anxiety amon females\\
- boys have more interest and  (Durndell and Haag, 2002, Jackson et al., 2001, Schottenbauer et al., 2004).enjoyment(Colley \& Comber, 2003)\\
\\
beliefs:\\
- boys have more positive perceptions than girls to ict\\
\\
Capabilities:\\
- Literature have no one consistent result about gender differences\\
\\
The model of the study favours en in belief and self-efficacy, but non-significant results in affective variable. Minimal reduction of the gap compared to wilthley 1997 study. The most reducted gap is in self eficcacy. Attitudinal gap favours men more in secondary school than in other parts. Is the place with the largest gap. No regional differences.}

  abstract = {The digital gender divide is one of the most critical issues in education today. Digital gender gaps can exist in students' access to and use of ICT, attitudes toward technology, and digital knowledge and skills. However, previous research has primarily examined these divides in isolation and largely ignored their interdependencies. Using student data from the 2013 and 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS), this study examines how these gaps are related. Specifically, we synthesize evidence on gender gaps in digital knowledge and skills, controlling for differences in ICT access and technology attitudes. In addition, we examine the role that technology attitudes play in the gender gap in digital knowledge and skills. Our findings suggest that (a) girls outperform boys in digital knowledge and skills ({$\beta$} = -0.11 to -0.29); (b) gender differences in attitudes toward technology partially explain gender differences in digital knowledge and skills; (c) the variability within and between countries in the gender gap in students' digital skills is partly explained by the type of digital skill and the country's socio-economic development and gender inequality. Overall, this research shows a relationship between the gender gaps in students' digital knowledge and skills and the gender gaps in students' attitudes toward technology. We conclude that the first- and second-level gender digital divides are connected.},
  langid = {english},
  annotation = {Researchers divide three type of gapes and study them in school and individual level. First gender gap is about access and attitudes to technologies. Second one's about digital knowledge and skills, and third gender divide is on differences of outcomes with technology (Educational or labourhood). Then try to explain how attitudes differences are related with performance in digital knowledge and skills.\\
\\
In the present study, we synthesize the evidence on the gender differences in digital skills after controlling for ICT access and attitudes toward technology. \\
\\
Moreover, we examine the mediating role of students' attitudes toward technology (see Fig. 1). In this study, we address the following research questions: 1. To what extent are gender differences in digital skills mediated by attitudes toward technology? 2. To what extent do the direct and indirect effects of gender on digital skills via attitudes toward technology vary across primary studies, countries, and types of attitudes toward technology? 3. To what extent do study, country, and measurement characteristics explain this heterogeneity?\\
\\
The present study addresses these gaps by employing an integrative data analysis (IDA) approach using individual participant data (IPD) from the 2013 and 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS).\\
\\
Something interesting from this study is they use CIL and CT test from icils as digital skills\\
\\
Distinct different attitudinal variables on icils:\\
- Affective: Intrinsic motivation and enjoyment (2013).\\
- Beliefs: Positive and negative outcome and expectations of future use.\\
- Selefficacy: Basic and advance.\\
\\
Results:\\
These findings showed that girls outperformed boys in digital skills, even after controlling for ICT access and affect. As the indirect effect of gender on digital skills via ICT affect was positive and different from zero, there was evidence for at least partial mediation of gender differences\\
\\
The ICT attitudes dimension of affect and beliefs also partially mediated the relation between gender and digital skills. Students' positive attitudes and interest in ICT are determinants of students' digital skills development (Erdogdu \& Erdogdu, 2022). However, gender gaps in favor of boys in the dimensions of affect and attitudes toward ICT have been reported in the literature (Cai et al., 2017). This integrative data analysis found a gender gap favoring boys in the ICT affect and beliefs dimensions. Furthermore, we found that boys with equal ICT access than girls performed better in digital skills partly due to differences in interest and positive attitudes toward ICT. Prior research on gender differences in digital skills showed that girls had a higher performance than boys (Siddiq \& Scherer, 2019), however, our findings indicate that the magnitude of the gender gaps in digital skills seems to reverse once interest and positive attitudes are considered. These results confirm the link between the first- and second-level gender digital divide and emphasize the need to address gender differences in attitudes toward technology to achieve digital equity.\\
\\
Taken together, the results of this research point to the link between the firstand second-level gender digital divide. The gender gaps in digital knowledge and skills could be partly explained by gender differences in attitudes toward technology.\\
\\
Overall, our findings indicate that the digital divide is not uniform across countries and samples, providing evidence about the variability of gender gaps in digital skills and attitudes toward technology, as reported in previous meta-analyses}

Self-efficacy beliefs have been identified as a factor that may contribute to the success with which a task is completed. Because of the increasing reliance on computer technologies in all aspects of life, it is important that the construct is measured accurately and appropriately. In particular, the article focuses on the measurement of computer self-efficacy (CSE) in student computer users and its relevance to learning in higher education. The scale was found to have high levels of internal and external reliability and construct validity. Results also showed there to be significant positive correlations between CSE and computer experience, and familiarity with computer software packages (which were significant predictors of CSE), and that owning a computer and computer training increased CSE. In addition, males showed significantly higher CSE than females. It is suggested that the scale may be used to identify individuals, in particular students, who will find it difficult to exploit a learning environment that relies heavily on computer technologies. Once identified, motivational and personal control issues can be addressed with these individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We propose that students' stereotypes about the culture of these fields---including the kind of people, the work involved, and the values of the field---steer girls away from choosing to enter them. Computer science and engineering are stereotyped in modern American culture as male-oriented fields that involve social isolation, an intense focus on machinery, and inborn brilliance. These stereotypes are compatible with qualities that are typically more valued in men than women in American culture. As a result, when computer science and engineering stereotypes are salient, girls report less interest in these fields than their male peers. However, altering these stereotypes---by broadening the representation of the people who do this work, the work itself, and the environments in which it occurs---significantly increases girls' sense of belonging and interest in the field. Academic stereotypes thus serve as gatekeepers, driving girls away from certain fields and constraining their learning opportunities and career aspirations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Specifically, ICT skills were defined as the capacity to solve problems of information, communication and knowledge in digital environments. A performance-based assessment was designed in a virtual environment to measure these skills. The analysis of the results showed that the majority of students were able to solve tasks related to the use of information as consumers, i.e., approximately three quarters of the students were able to search for information and half of them were also able to organize and manage digital information. Additionally, they show that very few students were able to succeed in tasks related to the use of information as producers, i.e., only one third of the students were able to develop their own ideas in a digital environment and less than one fifth were able to refine digital information and create a representation in a digital environment. Socioeconomic group, access, daily use and confidence in doing ICT-related activities were all positively associated with higher scores, showing the need to implement strategies to compensate this inequality, possibly by explicitly defining these aims in the national curriculum.},

Even more, frequency of use at school resulted low for all SEGs and much lower than its use at home, implying that ICT-related activities at school could have a relatively lower impact in individual differences.

In comparison with findings from a similar study undertaken in the early 1990s, there was some evidence of a reduced gender gap, particularly in the use of computers for applications such as word-processing, graphics, programming and maths. In addition, more recently introduced applications such as e-mail, accessing the internet and using CD-ROMs showed no overall gender difference in frequency of use. However, some gender differences remained, particularly in attitudes. Boys still liked computers more, were more self-confident in their use and, unlike previously, sex-typed them less than girls. They also used computers more frequently out of school, particularly for playing games. There was some evidence that, as found previously, older girls held the least positive attitudes, and it is suggested that their approach to computers may be influenced by the cultural pressures of gender stereotyping. More general age differences in use and attitudes were also found, and these may result from the different computing applications used by Year 7 and Year 11 pupils at school. In summary, although we found evidence of some change since the early 1990s, increased exposure to computes has not closed the gender gap.},

  abstract = {Public policies across the world are tackling Internet access inequality through mobile connections, which has led to an increase in mobile-only use. However, digital skills remain as a stumbling block to achieve digital inclusion. Using a two-wave panel survey on a representative sample conducted in Chile between 2018 and 2020, this study investigates how different mode of access (i.e. mobile-only vs mobile and computer) affects digital abilities over time. Results show significant differences in skills by mode of access. People who became hybrid users (mobile and computer) by wave 2 significantly gained skills while those who were hybrid and became mobile-only by wave 2 significantly lost abilities. People who did not change their type of access did not change their level of digital skills, despite the past of time and gained experience using the Internet. These conclusions show how mode of access may have a key effect on people's digital inclusion.},

Afterward, a summary of the evidence concerning how digital skills mediate the impact of structural disparities in tangible outcomes is presented, describing issues such as educational and occupational outcomes, subjective well-being, capital-enhancing consequences of internet use, and online safety and privacy. Finally, the article summarizes the key findings and outlines directions for future research on digital skills and socioeconomic inequalities, signaling the need to improve the measurement of digital skills and the scarce assessment of which policies work to foster and democratize them.},

  abstract = {Mobile devices were key drivers for recent Internet expansion in lower-income countries, democratizing access. Nonetheless, concerns arose regarding their role in the creation of new digital underclass related to the capital-enhancing consequences of Internet use. Among these, e-government engagement allows individuals to reduce the administrative burdens of governmental interactions. Nonetheless, its uptake has been proven to be highly stratified in Latin American countries where most services are not digital-by-default. The article argues that disparities in digital access play a role in this e-government divides. It examines the antecedents and determinants of household computer access and mobile-only Internet use, and e-government engagement in Brazil. Based on ``TIC Domicilios 2019'' survey, using logistic regressions to predict household access to computers, mobile-only Internet access, and e-government engagement. Mediation analyses of the latter models are conducted, testing the sequential nature of socio-digital inequalities based on the DiSTO framework. Findings show that living in a household with computers reduces the chances of being a mobile-only user and increases the odds of e-government engagement. Mobile-only access reduces e-government engagement. The effects of socioeconomic status and digital inequalities are mediated by household access to computers and mobile-only use. Implications for digital inclusion policies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Women's implicit associations between gender and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) may inhibit their desire to pursue and succeed in STEM careers. Little consensus exists regarding when these associations begin to develop and what may lead to changes over time. This study examined whether gender-STEM implicit associations of college women majoring in male-dominated STEM fields are less stereotypical than those who choose non-STEM, people-oriented, female-dominated majors (FDMs), whether these associations might differ between students at the start and end of their degree program, and whether these associations are related to previous STEM-relevant educational experiences or explicit STEM-gender associations. A Career Identity Implicit Association Test (IAT) measured implicit associations between personal identities and career choices and a Gender-Career IAT measured implicit associations between gender groups and careers in a sample of 240 college women (half STEM majors, half FDMs) who completed the study online. Half of each major group was composed of first year students and half were more advanced students (third year or beyond). We also assessed explicit gender-STEM stereotypes and early educational experiences related to STEM. Results indicated more counter-stereotypical associations for personal career identity and gender-career stereotypes among STEM women compared to non-STEM women, with no effect for year in school. Higher quality STEM educational experiences were also associated with counter-stereotypical scores on both IATs. Counterintuitively, explicit gender-STEM associations were related to less stereotypical scores on the Career-Identity IAT. Unexpectedly, STEM majors and advanced students reported more pronounced explicit gender-STEM associations than FDM majors and first-year students. Both IAT scores and early educational experiences predicted major choice. These results have novel implications for interventions that encourage women's participation in STEM.},

Significant zero order correlations were obtained with the relationships being between higher computer self efficacy, lower computer anxiety, more positive attitudes towards the Internet and longer reported use of the Internet. Significant gender effects were found throughout, with males tending to report greater computer self efficacy, lower computer anxiety, more positive attitudes towards the Internet and longer use of the Internet than females. However, regression analysis indicted that reported Internet experience (use) was the only variable independently linked to gender. It is argued that the results tend to support the contention that the literature on attitudes and anxiety towards computers is liable to extrapolate to the Internet. In particular this may apply to the gender dimension of this literature. It is also argued that the countries of Eastern Europe may now be manifesting the gender variations in relation to technology that are found in Western Europe.},

In polls inquiring about communion (e.g., affectionate, emotional), agency (e.g., ambitious, courageous), and competence (e.g., intelligent, creative), respondents indicated whether each trait is more true of women or men, or equally true of both. Women's relative advantage in communion increased over time, but men's relative advantage in agency showed no change. Belief in competence equality increased over time, along with belief in female superiority among those who indicated a sex difference in competence. Contemporary gender stereotypes thus convey substantial female advantage in communion and a smaller male advantage in agency but also gender equality in competence along with some female advantage. Interpretation emphasizes the origins of gender stereotypes in the social roles of women and men. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles. Evidence from varied research paradigms substantiates that these consequences occur, especially in situations that heighten perceptions of incongruity between the female gender role and leadership roles.

The qualities that define these roles become associated with the category as a whole, thus forming a stereotype. In a vicious cycle, this stereotype then hinders category members' movement into roles with different demands because their stereotype portrays them as well matched to their existing roles but not to these new roles. This vicious cycle has important implications for stereotype change. Given the difficulties of producing enduring change by directly attacking stereotypes in the minds of individuals, a more effective strategy consists of policies and programs that change the distributions of category members in roles, thereby changing stereotypes at their source. If the vicious cycle is not interrupted by such social change, observations of category members' typical social roles continually reinstate existing stereotypes.}

Prior research on Internet self-efficacy has been limited to examining specific task performance and narrow behavioral domains rather than overall attainments in relation to general Internet use, and has not yielded evidence of reliability and construct validity. Survey data were collected to develop a reliable operational measure of Internet self-efficacy and to examine its construct validity. An eight-item Internet self-efficacy scale developed for the present study was found to be reliable and internally consistent. Prior Internet experience, outcome expectancies and Internet use were significantly and positively correlated to Internet self-efficacy judgments. Internet stress and self-disparagement were negatively related to Internet self-efficacy. A path analysis model was tested within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory (Bandura (1997).}

Our broad purposes in taking this approach are to clarify some issues regarding the current status of the theory, make suggestions for next steps for research based in the theory, and justify our decision to call the theory Situated Expectancy-Value Theory (SEVT). First, we note how visual representations of the model make it appear static, linear, and monolithic, something that was not intended from its inception. Second, we discuss definitions of the major psychological constructs in the model, focusing on our and others' elaboration of the task value component, particularly the ``cost'' component. In this section we also discuss research on the development of expectancies and values. Third, we discuss the often-neglected middle part of the model focused on how individuals understand and interpret their own performance as well as the many messages they receive from different socializers regarding their activity participation and performance. In the fourth section we discuss the situative and culturally-focused aspects of the model, stressing the impact of the situation and cultural background on children's developing expectancy and value hierarchies. The fifth issue (one that we mention in several of the previous sections) concerns the importance of understanding the development of individuals' hierarchies of expectancies of success and subjective task values and how they relate to performance, choice, and engagement.},

  abstract = {Boys are doing worse in school than are girls, which has been dubbed ``the Boy Crisis.'' An analysis of the latest data on educational outcomes among boys and girls reveals extensive disparities in grades, reading and writing test scores, and other measurable educational outcomes, and these disparities exist across family resources and race. Focusing on disadvantaged schoolchildren, I then examine whether time investments made by boys and girls related to computer use contribute to the gender gap in academic achievement. Data from several sources indicate that boys are less likely to use computers for schoolwork and are more likely to use computers for playing games, but are less likely to use computers for social networking and email than are girls. Using data from a large field experiment randomly providing free personal computers to schoolchildren for home use, I also test whether these differential patterns of computer use displace homework time and ultimately translate into worse educational outcomes among boys. No evidence is found indicating that personal computers crowd out homework time and effort for disadvantaged boys relative to girls. Home computers also do not have negative effects on educational outcomes such as grades, test scores, courses completed, and tardies for disadvantaged boys relative to girls.},

  abstract = {This Open Access book summarizes the key findings from the second cycle of IEA's International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS), conducted in 2018. ICILS seeks to establish how well schools around the globe are responding to the need to provide young people with the necessary digital participatory competencies. Effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is an imperative for successful participation in an increasingly digital world. ICILS 2018 explores international differences in students' computer and information literacy (CIL), namely their ability to use computers to investigate, create, and communicate at home, at school, in the workplace, and in the community. Participating countries also had an option to administer an assessment of students' computational thinking (CT), focused on their ability to recognize aspects of real-world problems appropriate for computational formulation, and to evaluate and develop algorithmic solutions to those problems, so that the solutions could be operationalized with a computer. The data collected by ICILS 2018 show how digital competencies can be assessed using instruments representing authentic contexts for ICT use, and how students' CIL and CT skills relate to school learning experiences, out-of-school contexts, and student characteristics. Those data also show how learning technologies are used in classrooms around the world. Background questionnaires asked students about their use of ICT, and collected information from teachers, schools, and national education systems about the resourcing and teaching of CIL (and CT) within their countries. The results of ICILS 2018 will enable policymakers and education systems to develop a better understanding of the contexts and outcomes of CIL (and CT) education programs.},

Intriguingly, results from IEA's International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) of grade eight students, undertaken in 2013, indicated that female students generally had higher computer and information literacy (CIL) scale scores than male students. This book further analyzes the data collected by ICILS 2013, providing an in-depth investigation of the gender differences in the CIL abilities of students and their teachers. After establishing how CIL (and other similar constructs) are assessed, this chapter reviews the existing research into gender differences in students' CIL; this is based mainly on data collected by large-scale assessments. Patterns in students' use of information and computer technologies, their perceptions of computer technology, and their sense of competence in using computer technologies reveal gender differences that might be associated with the differing development of students' CIL. Gender differences among teachers, in their confidence in the use of computer technologies and their attitudes to the pedagogical use of those technologies, are also examined.},

An analysis of differential item functioning indicated that female students generally performed relatively better on tasks that involved communication, design, and creativity, while male students generally performed relatively better on more technical tasks, and those concerned with security. Female students took a little longer to complete the test than male students; this may have contributed to their better scores. While there were few differences between female and male students' basic information and communications technologies (ICT) self-efficacy, on average, male students recorded higher specialized ICT self-efficacy than female students in all 14 countries, and the difference was moderate to large in 12 of the 14 countries. General ICT self-efficacy was positively associated with both male and female CIL achievement to a similar extent in all 14 countries. Advanced ICT self-efficacy, however, was less strongly and less consistently related to CIL achievement.},

IEA's International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 revealed that female students achieved better CIL test scores than male students in most of the participating countries. The question then arises as to whether gender differences in the CIL performance of students are associated with differences in their affective responses to ICT and/or differences in their levels of ICT usage. These questions were investigated by analyzing data from the ICILS 2013 student assessments and student questionnaires. Male students notably reported significantly higher levels of interest in, and enjoyment of, ICT than their female peers in 13 of 14 ICILS countries, and interest-enjoyment also appeared to have a stronger relationship with achievement in CIL among male students than among female students. While there may be some gendered patterns of use of ICT that reflect different interests, these differences do not uniformly result in advantages or disadvantages for male or female students in terms of CIL achievement.},

While teachers are encouraged to integrate ICT into their teaching, there is evidence that the effectiveness of this integration depends to a large extent on teachers' preparedness to do so, which is directly related to their confidence and knowledge in using ICT, as well as their beliefs about the value of ICT in education. Female teachers using technology effectively provide a role model for young women at school, however previous studies have shown that female teachers are less likely to be using computers personally than their male counterparts. The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2013 teacher questionnaire provides a rich resource of data on teacher characteristics in relation to computer and information literacy and technology by gender. Analyses of female and male teachers' experiences, dispositions, and uses of ICT indicate that any differences are small and inconsistent across countries. Female and male teachers in secondary school do not appear to differ greatly in the extent of their pedagogical use of ICT.},

Publication bias was tested through funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Results Findings show a symmetric distribution of effects, making it possible to conclude that no file-drawer problem affected the collected sample of effects. Aggregating the results of the reviewed studies, a medium effect of stereotype threat manipulation on women's sport performances emerged (d\,=\,0.33). Collected studies were coded for stereotypicality of threatened exercise. The effect of stereotype threat was significantly higher for sports activities perceived as masculine. Conclusions This meta-analysis reveals that gender stereotype affects the sport activities of women and that this is particularly true for sports typically considered suited to males.}

Two important findings emerge from this research. First, greater ethnic diversity in classrooms and schools reduces students' feelings of victimization and vulnerability, because there is more balance of power among different ethnic groups. Second, in nondiverse classrooms where one ethnic group enjoys a numerical majority, victimized students who are members of the ethnic group that is in the majority may be particularly vulnerable to self-blaming attributions. The usefulness of attribution theory as a conceptual framework and ethnicity as a context variable in studies of peer victimization are discussed.},

The interaction between behavior management (1 dimension of classroom quality) and classroom age composition was also significant, indicating that a wider distribution of classroom age composition was positively related to children's vocabulary gains within classrooms characterized by better behavior management. Practice or Policy Findings underscore the importance of children's social interactions with more knowledgeable conversational partners in promoting their vocabulary development and signify the need to help teachers learn how to manage children's behaviors so as to provide a classroom that is optimal for child learning.},

As predicted, men reported higher opportunity evaluation than women when no gender stereotypical information was presented, whereas men and women evaluated the business opportunity equally favorably when entrepreneurs were described using gender-neutral attributes. Interestingly, gender differences in opportunity evaluation were exacerbated when entrepreneurship was linked to masculine stereotypical information, and reversed in favor of women when entrepreneurship was linked to feminine stereotypical information.

In this article, Patricia Gurin, Eric Dey, Sylvia Hurtado, and Gerald Gurin explore the relationship between students' experiences with diverse peers in the college or university setting and their educational outcomes. Rooted in theories of cognitive development and social psychology, the authors present a framework for understanding how diversity introduces the relational discontinuities critical to identity construction and its subsequent role in fostering cognitive growth. Using both single- and multi-institutional data from the University of Michigan and the Cooperative Institutional Research Program, the authors go on to examine the effects of classroom diversity and informal interaction among African American, Asian American, Latino/a, and White students on learning and democracy outcomes. The results of their analyses underscore the educational and civic importance of informal interaction among different racial and ethnic groups during the college years. The authors offer their findings as evidence of the continuing importance of affirmative action and diversity efforts by colleges and universities, not only as a means of increasing access to higher education for greater numbers of students, but also as a means of fostering students' academic and social growth.},

  abstract = {From a systematic review of the existing literature in databases such as WoS, Scopus and Scielo and by making use of the PRISMA model, 25 articles on the relationship between gender and occupational segregation in the last 5 years in Chile have been analyzed. Horizontal occupational segregation begins at the very moment in which women choose their degree since it will have a repercussion in their future for it affects their future decisions, their future working life, their fields of expertise and even there are learning methodologies linked to gender. The presence of stereotypes and role models affecting the occupational breakdown by gender are catalysts of the intrinsic constraints (internalized beliefs) and extrinsic constraints (those linked to the norms and existing procedures, or the absence of them in higher education), since they discourage the irruption of women in fields which have been traditionally associated to men. With regards to higher education, women tend to enroll in the fields of health, education and social services whilst men focus on STEM fields. It is important to highlight that in Chile there are more women who enroll in the university regardless of the nature of the institution. However, there are fields of knowledge in which the gender gap is sharp. According to the data gathered by the Subsecretar{\'i}a de Educaci{\'o}n Superior of Chile, the gender gap in basic sciences is -0.1\% whilst it reaches a -65.7\% in Technology.},

Have gender stereotypes changed over this time period to reflect the new realities? And, to what extent does gender stereotyping exist today? We address these questions by comparing data collected in the early 1980s to new data collected in 2014. In each study, participants rated the likelihood that a typical man or woman has a set of gendered characteristics (traits, role behaviors, occupations, and physical characteristics). Results indicate that people perceive strong differences between men and women on stereotype components today, as they did in the past. Comparisons between the two time periods show stability of gender stereotypes across all components except female gender roles, which showed a significant increase in gender stereotyping. These results attest to the durability of basic stereotypes about how men and women are perceived to differ, despite changes in the participation and acceptance of women and men in nontraditional domains. Because gender stereotypes are apparently so deeply embedded in our society, those in a position to evaluate women and men, as well as women and men themselves, need to be constantly vigilant to the possible influence of stereotypes on their judgments, choices, and actions.

Concurrently, existing work on science and math abilities of students suggests that such perceived differences do not always translate into actual disparities. We examine the yet-neglected area concerning gender differences with respect to Internet-use ability. In particular, we test how self-perceived abilities are related to actual abilities and how these may differ by gender. Methods. We use new data on web-use skill to test empirically whether there are differences in men's and women's abilities to navigate online content. We draw on a diverse sample of adult Internet users to investigate the questions raised. Results. Findings suggest that men and women do not differ greatly in their online abilities. However, we find that women's self-assessed skill is significantly lower than that of men. Conclusions. Women's lower self-assessment regarding their web-use skills may affect significantly the extent of their online behavior and the types of uses to which they put the medium. We discuss the implications of these findings for social inequality.},

  abstract = {Self-efficacy is an important concept for understanding learning and achievement. The concept covers students' self-confidence and their expectations for future performance. Students' learning experiences are crucial for the development of self-efficacy beliefs, which may affect students' achievements. The present study explores how self-efficacy can be contextualized with information and communication technology in 15 countries. A theoretical model is built and tested in each country based on data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2013. The analyses show that experience with technology, autonomous learning, and socioeconomic background explain the variations in ICT self-efficacy. Further, gender, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic background play important roles in understanding students' computer and information literacies. This indicates that ICT self-efficacy is positively related to computer and information literacy when controlled for other student characteristics and background contextual variables. The results reveal a clear distinction between ICT self-efficacy and computer and information literacy.},

  annotation = {To start to introduce ICT self efficacy, oriented to gender gap.\\
\\
"self-efficacy is a belief about what one is capable of doing or learning and is not the same as knowing what to do. his means that students are more likely to pursue activities within their ranges of perceived competences; they tend to select tasks and activities in which they feel competent and avoid those in which they do not."\\
\\
To justify self-efficacy variable: In education, self-efficacy has proved to affect students' choices of activities, effort invested, persistence, interests, and achievements (Schunk \& Pajares, 2009), as well as the use of self-regulatory processes (Zimmerman, 2000). Compared to students who doubt their capabilities to perform well, self-efficacious students work harder, persist longer, show greater interest in learning, and achieve at higher levels (Bandura, 1997). They are not afraid to undertake challenging tasks, and are motivated to use cognitive and metacognitive strategies when faced with obstacles or challenges in learning situations (Zimmerman, 2000).\\
\\
Why under and over estimation is important:  "Students who overestimate their competences may sometimes fail, which can lower their motivation. On the other hand, students who underestimate what they are capable of doing may be unwilling to try, and they therefor reduce their acquisition of skills. Research also shows that self-efficacy beliefs can be related to gender and culture (Dettingen, 1995). Though girls perform as competently as or even better than boys in various academic domains, they are inclined to report lower self-efficacy, especially in mathematics and science (Schunk, Meece, \& Pintrich, 2014)."\\
\\
"For the purposes herein, personal characteristics deal with students' ICT experiences, their ICT uses at home and at school, autonomous learning, and gender, and the environment is represented by students' home backgrounds" --{$>$} In enviroment, there's no gender composition of school as a variable, what justify our research\\
\\
Path to study school selfefficacy: \\
1. Ict self efficacy and CIL relationship\\
2. Students use of ICT at school and self efficacy\\
3. Students use of ICT out of school and selfefficacy\\
4. Autonomous learning and self efficacya\\
5. Gender:  "Students' computer self-efficacy has also been studied from a gender perspective with consistent findings. In general, girls seem to be less confident than boys. Recent research indicates that males tend to overestimate their ICT literacies, whereas females seem to underestimate their capabilities (Hargittai and Shafer, 2006, Litt, 2013, Meelissen and Drent, 2008, Tsai et al., 2010, T{\o}mte and Hatlevik, 2011, Vekiri and Chronaki, 2008). Especially in more complex computer tasks, male students tend to have more confidence in their computer abilities than their female peers (Meelissen and Drent, 2008, Vekiri and Chronaki, 2008). These gender differences have been registered as early as fifth and sixth grade. In the ICIL 2013, larger gender differences in ICT self-efficacy were observed when conducting advanced ICT tasks compared to basic tasks. This tendency was registered across most countries (Fraillon et al., 2014).\\
\\
Nevertheless, when it comes to students' actual achievements (i.e., measured ICT literacy), the findings are less consistent. Some studies report no gender differences (Hargittai and Shafer, 2006, Hatlevik and Christophersen, 2013, Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2009), while others find that males perform better than females (Calvani et al., 2012, Gui and Argentin, 2011, Van Deursen, 2012). Finally, in a range of studies, females demonstrate significantly higher levels of ICT literacy than males (Ainley et al., 2007, Baek et al., 2009, Fraillon et al., 2014)."\\
\\
6. Home Background\\
\\
Chile in icils 2013 is the most country with ict self efficacy influenced by SES of parents\\
\\
"Girls obtain higher CIL scores than boys, and in many countries they report higher ICT self-efficacy. This result may indicate a change in previous gender stereotypes. The present study does not provide any information about why these changes occurred. Therefore, it would be interesting to scrutinize the gender differences in CIL to gain more knowledge about what implications gender may have for instruction in schools." --{$>$} Take this limitation}

It is proposed that gender stereotypes and the expectations they produce about both what women are like (descriptive) and how they should behave (prescriptive) can result in devaluation of their performance, denial of credit to them for their successes, or their penalization for being competent. The processes giving rise to these outcomes are explored, and the procedures that are likely to encourage them are identified. Because of gender bias and the way in which it influences evaluations in work settings, it is argued that being competent does not ensure that a woman will advance to the same organizational level as an equivalently performing man.

Its central argument is that gender stereotypes give rise to biased judgments and decisions, impeding women's advancement. The paper discusses how descriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias because of the negative performance expectations that result from the perception that there is a poor fit between what women are like and the attributes believed necessary for successful performance in male gender-typed positions and roles. It also discusses how prescriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias by creating normative standards for behavior that induce disapproval and social penalties when they are directly violated or when violation is inferred because a woman is successful. Research is presented that tests these ideas, considers specific career consequences likely to result from stereotype-based bias, and identifies conditions that exaggerate or minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.}

The results of t test statistical analyses, which examined only gender differences in demonstrated and perceived ICT skills, indicate significant differences in all areas in favor of females. Females had higher factor scores in perception measures for Frequency of Computer Use, Perceived ICT Skills, and Attitudes toward Computers. In addition, female students had significantly higher scores on all six sections from the Student Tool for Technology Literacy, a performance-based assessment. These results counter many empirical research studies that show males generally perform better with ICT skills and have overall better attitudes toward computers than their female counterparts. However, when adding predictors to the model and using multilevel modeling statistical methods, findings indicate that gender was no longer significant. These findings question the importance of the gender differences related to ICT skills that were found with previous statistical examinations. Using more advanced statistical methods to answer research questions pertaining to ICT skills is important in order to determine which factors have the greatest potential for intervention programs that focus on developing equitable ICT skills and career choices for all students.},

It argues that digital technologies change the context for individuals' careers and the opportunities that exist for the provision of career support. The implications of digital technologies for career are dependent, in part, on how technologies are believed to interact with society. They may be thought of as tools, as shapers of society, or as social practices. For individuals, digital technologies can be understood through six metaphors: (1) library, (2) media channel, (3) surveillance camera, (4) marketplace, (5) meeting place, and (6) arena. For career development professionals, the choice is using them to provide information, automated interactions, or communication. The chapter concludes by arguing that there are three main pedagogic stances (instrumental, connectivist, or critical) that can guide career development professionals in the combination of different technologies and in the resolution of the opportunities and challenges that are presented to individuals in their career building.},

The test was based on the revised Finnish national core curriculum for basic education. Based on the results, there was a small, but statistically, significant difference between the genders in the total scores on the ICT skill test. More consequential differences between the genders were found in the item level analysis. As explicit item level analysis indicated, boys tended to get better scores from more technical-oriented items, while girls got better scores from school work-oriented and social interaction-related items. The results emphasize that gender differences in ICT skills are more item specific than general. More importantly, the variation between individuals in ICT skill items was extensive and in all likelihood more influential than the gender difference as such.},

The research results provide knowledge on the differences and digital divides. When examining ICT skill levels, the accuracy of assessment is one of the key issues to address the results and gain the applicable data for appropriate interventions to enhance digital inclusion. To date, ICT skill assessment is based mainly on self-reports and subjective evaluations. However, as previous studies have shown, people tend to overrate or underrate their own levels of competence. Thus, novel performance-based approach for assessing ICT skills is presented in this paper. The ICT skill test contains 42 tasks grouped into 17 ICT fields. The study was conducted with upper comprehensive and upper secondary level school students (n~=~3159) and their teachers (n~=~626) during years 2014--2016 in Finland. Using factor analysis, three ICT skills factors were created: basic digital skills, advanced technical skills, and professional ICT skills. The performance in the ICT skill test was also divided by gender, as the male students and teachers outperformed the female students and teacher. Outperformance also occurred by educational level, as both upper secondary level students and teachers were seen as possessing higher-level ICT skills than students and teachers at the comprehensive level. We thus argue that to compare the ICT skills and the validity of the assessments, we needed to ensure consistent assessment for both students and teachers. In addition, in order to diminish the ICT skill gap among students, interventions using formal education are urgently needed, and in particular, more attention should be given to both teacher training and in-service training.},

In this article, I comprehensively review the academic literature on board gender composition. Using the systematic review method, I ask whether women directors really are different from men on boards, what factors shape board gender composition, how board gender composition affects organizational outcomes, and finally, why board gender quotas and other forms of regulation are introduced and what outcomes can be expected. Based on my findings, I develop a conceptual framework that clarifies the causal processes underlying both women's access to boards and the effects of women's presence on boards. Finally, I offer a research agenda designed to enrich our understanding of board gender composition.},

Symptoms of teachers' stress and burnout (e.g., emotional exhaustion) are also thought to influence students' achievement, but no empirical study has tested this prediction. Using multilevel analyses and a representative sample consisting of 1,102 German elementary school teachers and their students, we addressed this gap in knowledge by examining the association between teachers' emotional exhaustion and students' achievement in mathematics, and by testing whether classroom composition moderates this relation. We controlled for teachers' gender, their years of experience, their teaching certificate, and the composition of the class, and on the student level for students' gender, language spoken at home, socioeconomic status, and cognitive ability. Results revealed that teachers' emotional exhaustion was significantly negatively related to students' mathematics achievement, even after teacher characteristics and classroom composition were controlled for. Classroom composition moderated this relation, whereby teachers' emotional exhaustion was more strongly related to students' achievement in classes with a high percentage of language minority students. These results highlight the importance of teachers' well-being for students' learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

The final part of the task was prepared to provide an experience of failure: due to a faulty USB-memory stick, completion of the task was not possible.

Afterward, the feasibility of theoretical synthesis is considered. Finally, some possible directions are proposed for theoretical integration among five contemporary theories of social and gender development: social cognitive theory, expectancy-value theory, cognitive-developmental theory, gender schema theory, and self-categorization theory.},

This article analyses findings from a national survey of UK 9---19-year-olds that reveal inequalities by age, gender and socioeconomic status in relation to their quality of access to and use of the internet. Since both the extent of use and the reasons for low- and non-use of the internet vary by age, a different explanation for the digital divide is required for children compared with adults. Looking beyond the idea of a binary divide, we propose instead a continuum of digital inclusion. Gradations in frequency of internet use (from non and low users through to weekly and daily users) are found to map onto a progression in the take-up of online opportunities among young people (from basic through moderate to broad and then all-round users), thus beginning to explain why differences in internet use matter, contributing to inclusion and exclusion. Demographic, use and expertise variables are all shown to play a role in accounting for variations in the breadth and depth of internet use.},

Interestingly a gender gap occurred in all age-groups for both factors (interest in technology and social aspects of technology). Not surprisingly, male participants showed significantly higher interest and social adjustment to technology. Only in the social context for male and female in-service teachers did no gender difference appeared. Consequently, technology in schools needs an introduction at young ages, where interest in both technology and its social aspects develops and needs support.},

First, we examine how cultural stereotypes specific to STEM contribute to gender gaps by negatively impacting interest and academic outcomes. Second, we review the central role of the self-representations affected by those stereotypes, including the particular importance of a sense of belonging in STEM. Third, we discuss various interventions that buffer against stereotypes and enhance a sense of belonging to improve interest and academic outcomes. We find that STEM gender gaps in interest and academic outcomes are malleable and can be changed through interventions. Finally, we suggest directions for future research.

However, despite the numerous studies on this subject, consensus about explanations for these gender differences in computer attitudes is still lacking. Three main theories will be discussed: socialisation, gender specific behaviour and the influence of teaching. Compared to computer attitude studies, the availability of studies and theories on students' computer competencies is much more limited.

(in press). Because it's boring, irrelevant and I don't like computers': Why high school girls avoid professionally-oriented ICT subjects. Computers \& Education.]. Policy makers as well as researchers often assume that the interest of girls in computing and ICT-professions could be increased at school. For example, female teachers who are confident ICT-users, are expected to act as positive role models for girls. However, because most of the research on gender and computing has been focussing on the influence of none-school related factors, there is little empirical evidence that schools or teachers are able to influence girls' attitude toward ICT. Using the data of a Dutch large-scale survey on ICT use in primary education (almost 4000 grade 5 students), this study explores the influence of both none-school related factors and school related factors on students' computer attitude. Although the between-school variance of girls' computer attitude is higher than that of boys' computer attitude, multilevel analyses show that most of the variance in computer attitude is explained by none-school related student factors. Two school related factors turned out to have a small positive effect on the computer attitude of girls: a teacher-centred pedagogical approach and the computer experience of female teachers.},

- More boys than girls have gender stereotyped views of computers.

Girls with less gender-stereotyped views on computers were expected to have more positive computer attitudes. --{$>$} Really important!\\
- ecause girls show lower intensity and lower self-efficacy in computer use than boys, these reciprocal relations may increase gender differences in computer attitudes in the long term. In other words, gender differences in computer attitude may increase with age.\\
- However, if the teacher is female, the computer experience of the teacher has a small effect on girls' computer attitude (.07, Table 4). This significant interaction effect accords with the `role model theory'. This theory assumes that female teachers who are confident in using ICT can enhance the attractiveness of computers for girls (e.g. Brosnan, 1998). \\
- In other words, although female teachers show the same intensity and the same variety in ICT use for educational purposes, they are less convinced about their ICT knowledge and skills than their male colleagues are.\\

Secondly, to understand the variation of digital diffusion and digital literacy across areas (with different levels of poverty), age groups, genders and occupations. The data is collected from surveys focused on measuring the access to information, digital diffusion and the use of technology among the poor. This study found that there is a digital divide problem among people in urban areas, especially among people with low incomes. Moreover, the diffusion is dominated by certain groups such as younger people and females. Furthermore, digital literacy among the poor is low. The policy implication is to improve access for digital diffusion and provide assistance to improve digital literacy skills.},

The children of the parents involved were all enrolled in nursery and reception classes (4---5 years of age) in two settings (referred to hereafter as Stafford School and Hill School). The term home is used here to denote any context in children's lives beyond the school/nursery environs whilst the interpretation of ICT is equally broad and inclusive in nature and encompasses any technology associated with the handling and electronic transmission of information and/or its use in controlling the operations of machines and other devices (HMI, 1989). In this context therefore ICT would include such things as telephones, televisions, video, audio recorders, CD and DVD players, CD-ROMs, programmable toys, games consoles, radios and, of course, computers. The study found that differences in the incidence and availability of ICT in the children's homes could be subtle on occasion and were the result of a number of factors. Children might have `access' to certain technologies in that they were present in their home environments but this did not necessarily mean that children were always able and/or allowed to `use' those technologies. It supports the arguments made by Marsh and others elsewhere (Marsh, 2004; Marsh et al., 2005) that young children are already in possession of ICT knowledge and competences when they arrive in nursery and reception classes partly as a result of varying levels of parental intervention and modelling as well as being in the process of acquiring new knowledge, skills and attitudes. The study also argues that parents' involvement with ICT was often characterized by conscious but sometimes uncertain efforts to limit opportunities and access to ICT in the perceived best interests of the children (Clarke, 2006).},

  abstract = {Decreasing student attrition rates is one of the main objectives of most higher education institutions. However, to achieve this goal, universities need to accurately identify and focus their efforts on students most likely to quit their studies before they graduate. This has given rise to a need to implement forecasting models to predict which students will eventually drop out. In this paper, we present an early warning system to automatically identify first-semester students at high risk of dropping out. The system is based on a machine learning model trained from historical data on first-semester students. The results show that the system can predict ``at-risk'' students with a sensitivity of 61.97\%, which allows early intervention for those students, thereby reducing the student attrition rate.},

This study used the ICILS data to explore whether the achievement test used in this study addressed specific dimensions of CIL and, if so, whether the performances of girls and boys on these subscales differ. We investigated the hypothesis that gender differences in performance on computer literacy items would be slightly in favour of boys, whereas gender differences in performance on information literacy items would be slightly in favour of girls. Furthermore, it was examined whether such differences varied across European countries and if item bias was present. Data was analysed using a confirmative factor analysis model, i.e. a multidimensional item response theory model, for the identification of the subscales, the explorations of gender and national differences, and possible item bias. To a large extent the results support our postulated hypothesis and shed new light on the commonly assumed disadvantaged position of girls and women in modern information society.},

This systematic review aims to examine the gender differences in ICT use and skills for learning through technology. A comprehensive search of eight journal databases and a specific selection criterion was carried out to exclude articles that match our stated exclusion criteria. We included 42 peer-reviewed empirical publications and conference proceedings published between 2006 and 2020. For a subsample of studies, we performed a small-scale meta-analysis to quantify possible gender differences in ICT use and skills. A random-effects model uncovered a small and positive, yet not significant, effect size in favor of boys (g~=\,0.17, 95\% CI [-0.01, 0.36]). However, this finding needs to be further backed by large-scale meta-analyses, including more study samples and a broader set of ICT use and skills measures. We highlight several concerns that should be addressed and more thoroughly in collaboration with one another to better IT skills and inspire new policies to increase the quality of ICT use. The findings from this review further suggest implications and present existing research challenges and point to future research directions.},

Hence, this study addressed the following questions: (a) Are newcomers in the classroom more likely to become victims? (b) Does a stable classroom, where children generally have the same classmates over time, lead to less change in bully nominations? To address these questions, this article examined 3 waves of bully nominations in a sample of 3,254 children (50\% boys; age 8--12) in 31 elementary schools, displaying three types of schools: stable or unstable administrative or pedagogical multigrade. Both research questions were answered by longitudinal social network analyses of the school-wide networks. The meta-analyzed results of these analyses with small effect sizes showed that (a) although stable classrooms do not necessarily show less change in bully nominations than in unstable classrooms, victim-bully ties are more likely to develop among students in the same grade or same classroom and (b) newcomers were more likely to become victims, more so in unstable schools than in stable schools.

Analyses were based on data collected in 352 German 9th-grade classrooms across 2 measurement points in a multilevel framework. We found that students in classrooms with a higher proportion of language minority students were more intrinsically motivated to learn. However, we found no statistical evidence for the prediction that the compositional effect should be mediated by the instructional climate in the classroom. Cross-level interaction analyses revealed that only language minority students were increasingly motivated in classrooms with a higher proportion of language minority students. Our findings add to the growing evidence indicating that the nature and quality of the social environment are important determinants of school-related motivation.},

Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being.

For this purpose, their positive, negative, and neutral perceptions of the associated characteristics of these workers were also analyzed. Likewise, the use of masculine, feminine, or neutral expressions to describe these professionals was explored. The existence of gender differences in these aspects was also investigated. 900 students from Catalonia (51~\% girls) enrolled in the last course of junior secondary education (mean of age=15~years old; S.D.\,=\,1.73) participated in a survey with close and open-ended questions. Content analysis of responses to an open-ended question indicated that the boys and girls held several stereotypical beliefs about ICT professionals (a highly male-dominated field), but they also reported counter-stereotypical beliefs about them. As expected, these stereotypical beliefs described a masculine portrayal of ICT workers. Contrary to expectations, most of the students' portrayals of people working in ICT were either positive or neutral, not negative. Likewise and opposite to predictions, young males did not show more positive attitudes towards ICT professionals than girls. In fact, both girls and boys evaluated more positively than negatively the different descriptive aspects associated with ICT professionals. In support of expectations, most boys and girls referred to masculine role models working in ICT. No gender differences were observed in the type of characteristics associated with ICT professionals. However, young females were more likely to offer feminine references about professions where ICT is the tool rather than the object of their work. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings within the context of Spain are discussed.},

We find that having at least one female teacher in secondary STEM-VTE programs increases overall enrollment in STEM higher education programs by 2.1 percentage points, primarily driven by women choosing postsecondary VTE diplomas in STEM fields. The effect of female VTE teachers in enrollment in these diplomas reaches 4.0 percentage points, equivalent to an 18\% reduction in the observed gender gap. We argue that female VTE teachers, acting as role models, have the potential to mitigate the traditional barriers that young women encounter to persist in the STEM pipeline, thereby contributing to closing the STEM gender gap.},

Overall, we find a student--teacher female gender match effect of 2.1 percentage points on STEM enrollment in higher education.\\

However, our result also indicates that having a female teacher in STEM-VTE has a slightly negative impact on female enrollment in STEM bachelor's degrees. Indeed, being taught by a STEM-VTE female teacher rather than a male teacher increases in 4.0 percentage points the probability of enrolling in VTE diplomas, a more specialized and practical STEM higher education kind of program. This effect is equivalent to an 18\% reduction in the gender gap observed in the enrollment of STEM-VTE diplomas among graduates from secondary STEM-VTE programs in 2018.}

The authors then test whether the new CT identification measure could uniquely explain the relationship between individuals' gender and CT career pursuit, above and beyond math identification. Finally, the authors examine the relationships between men's and women's CT domain identification, their perceptions of the CT field, and their interpersonal orientation to determine whether existing relationships among these variables might explain individuals' willingness to consider a number of CT-and non-CT-related fields.},

Reflecting the pressure of this vulnerability, Blacks underperformed in relation to Whites in the ability-diagnostic condition but not in the nondiagnostic condition (with Scholastic Aptitude Tests controlled). Study 3 validated that ability-diagnosticity cognitively activated the racial stereotype in these participants and motivated them not to conform to it, or to be judged by it.

Students in grades 8 and 9 (n\,=\,506) completed a survey before and after visiting the science center, and their ratings were compared to a wait-list control group (n\,=\,169). The students participated in block-based, text-based, and robot programming exercises developed by the science center. The results showed that programming ability beliefs increased for women, but not men, and that interest in programming decreased for men, but not women. The effects persisted at a follow-up (2--3~months). The young men reported stronger ability beliefs and interest than the young women at all timepoints. The results imply that science center activities can make programming feel less hard, but adaptations may be needed to also increase interest.},

We measured technology/caregiving gender stereotypes with implicit (the Implicit Association Test) and explicit (self-report) measures in a sample of middle school students (n\,=\,873). The results supported the main hypotheses, and corroborate Eccles's expectancy value theory, indicating that the endorsement of implicit gender stereotypes may serve as barriers to pursuing masculine-typed career paths for women. Further, a sample of middle school teachers (n\,=\,86) showed stronger implicit gender stereotypes than the students. Unexpectedly, middle school girls with a foreign background showed no implicit gender stereotypes, which we discuss in relation to the gender-equality paradox. These findings suggest that to fulfill the recruitment needs of an increasingly digitalized world, the tech-industry and other stakeholders should put effort into counteracting the stereotype that technology is for men.},

We use four cohorts of 5th grade student's assessment of Math and Portuguese in Brazilian elementary public schools and apply an identification strategy relying on school level gender peer effects and school fixed effects to control for self-selection of students across schools. We identify a positive relationship between scholastic achievement and the proportion of female students. This effect is underlined by improvements in student behavior, as indicated by teachers' assessment of student's academic potential, self-esteem, interest, discipline, absenteeism, and perception about syllabus coverage and school violence. Hence, this research draws attention to gender as an important factor in the allocation of students and teachers within schools. The consideration of our findings in the formulation and execution of policies can result in effective low-cost measures aimed at increasing achievement.}

Self-efficacy is an important theoretical and empirical concept to identify and describe how students perceive their own ability to solve a task. ICT user profiles were developed as an empirical framework to identify and categorize students based on how frequent they use ICT. In this paper, we have chosen six ICT user profiles in order to distinguish between leisure activities and school activities. Each ICT user-profile was computed by combining two dimensions (frequency of ICT use for leisure purposes and frequency of ICT use for school purposes). We tried to identify how students' perception of their ability to solve a task is related to both their gender and how frequently they use ICT. The results showed that student's self-efficacy varied between the ICT user profiles. The findings showed how an increased level of self-efficacy in ICT High-level tasks is related to both an increased level of leisure use and with an increased level of educational use. Further, our findings provided evidence in support of positive relationships (for both males and the females) between Self-efficacy in ICT and the ICT user profiles.},

A total of 1080 eighth graders were randomly selected from all junior high school students in Taiwan. The Internet Self-Efficacy Scale (ISES) was developed and used to examine students' Internet self-efficacy in two dimensions: online exploration (explorative ISE) and online communication (communicative ISE). A survey including the ISES instrument was administered to all the subjects and finally 936 valid questionnaires (from 466 males and 470 females) were returned for data analyses. No significant gender difference was found in students' total ISE and explorative ISE; however, a significant gender difference was found in students' communicative ISE. Surprisingly, the girls had significant higher communicative ISE than had the boys. In addition, there was no significant gender difference in students' Internet using experience and computer ownerships; however, there were significant gender differences in their Internet using purpose and intensity. In spite of the boys showed a significantly higher Internet use intensity than did the girls, the boys were more exploration-oriented Internet users and the girls were more communication-oriented Internet users. And this orientation played a significant role in their Internet self-efficacy. These results suggested that the gender gap may no longer exist in young students' confidence in using the Internet. However, boys and girls used the Internet for significantly different purposes suggesting that the Internet played different roles for boys and girls in Taiwan. With a large scale examination by using a valid and reliable instrument, this study provided representative results for further related studies.},

Much of the work on the social psychology of intergroup relations has focused on patterns of individual prejudices and discrimination and on the motivational sequences of interpersonal interaction. The intensity of explicit intergroup conflicts of interests is closely related in human cultures to the degree of opprobrium attached to the notion of "renegade" or "traitor." The basic and highly reliable finding is that the trivial, ad hoc intergroup categorization leads to in-group favoritism and discrimination against the out-group. Many orthodox definitions of "social groups" are unduly restrictive when applied to the context of intergroup relations. The equation of social competition and intergroup conflict rests on the assumptions concerning an "ideal type" of social stratification in which the salient dimensions of intergroup differentiation are those involving scarce resources.},

Participants responded to a questionnaire about their access to computer use outside school (e.g. frequency of use and nature of activities), perceived parental and peer support, and computer self-efficacy and value beliefs. Although almost all students used computers outside school, there were significant gender differences in frequency and type of computer use. Also, boys reported more perceived support from their parents and peers to use computers and more positive computer self-efficacy and value beliefs than girls. Parental support and, to a lesser extent, peer support were the factors more strongly associated with boys' and girls' computer self-efficacy and value beliefs, while home computer access was not related to students' motivation. Our findings highlight the role of socialization in the gender gap in computing and the need for research and educational interventions that focus on the social practices that communicate gendered expectations to young boys and girls.},
  keywords = {Elementary education,Gender studies},
  annotation = {We hypothesized that, if gender differences do exist, they are not inevitable or ``natural'' but rather the result of different socialization experiences of boys and girls and a reflection of gendered social expectations expressed by family and peers. In our study, we hypothesized that these differences in girls' and boys' computer value and self-efficacy beliefs are related to the social support they receive for using computer activities and to the quality of computer experiences outside the school context.\\
\\
{\textquestiondown}Why is important self-efficacy ICT? "Research on achievement motivation has established the role of self-efficacy and task-value beliefs in students' academic choices, learning, and school performance (Bandura, 1993, Eccles and Wigfield, 1995). Self-efficacy beliefs are students' cognitive evaluations of their ability to successfully perform tasks of a particular domain (Bandura, 1993), and task-value beliefs concern students' reason for engaging in those tasks: their beliefs about the enjoyment they will get from the task (intrinsic value), the importance (attainment value) and the usefulness of the task (utility value) (Eccles \& Wigfield, 1995). Students are more likely to pursue academic activities that they consider valuable (Dickh{\"a}user \& Stiensmeier-Pelster, 2003) and within their range of perceived competence (Bandura, 1993). More importantly, both self-efficacy and task-value beliefs are significant predictors of students' future academic and career trajectories. Students with positive self-efficacy tend to engage thoughtfully (Pintrich \& DeGroot, 1990) and, as a result, to succeed in current learning activities and, therefore, prepare themselves better for future academic pursuits and are able to consider more career options (Bandura et al., 2001). Similarly, female and male students pursue academic studies and careers based on their value beliefs regarding the subject matter (Dickh{\"a}user and Stiensmeier-Pelster, 2003, Jacobs et al., 1998)."\\
\\
Family and friend support encourage the motivation and self-efficacy of technologies: "we found significant positive correlations between students' motivational beliefs and their social support and experiences. Students who thought that their parents encouraged them to use computers or whose friends supported their efforts to learn and shared their interest in computers were also more confident about their computer abilities, had more positive views about the value of computer learning, and tended to engage in a variety of computer activities. Students who had positive self-efficacy beliefs were also likely to think that computer learning was valuable to them. Finally, students who had positive self-efficacy and value beliefs were also likely to use computers for a large variety of tasks. In general, the patterns in these relationships were similar for boys and girls."\\
\\
When we used self-efficacy as the dependent variable, SES was marginally related to boys' self-efficacy only (see Table 6). Specifically, low SES was negatively related to boys' self-efficacy beliefs. When we entered student's computer experiences, the effects of SES diminished and only frequency of use and activity variety were significant. However, when the social support variables were added to the model, the effects of the computer experience variables decreased and parental support was the variable more strongly associated with self-efficacy for both boys and girls. Peer support was significant for boys and girls, frequency of computer use was marginally associated with girls' self-efficacy and activity variety was significant for both boys and girls. Interestingly, home computer access did not emerge as a significant variable for either boys or girls.\\
\\
We can add SES of parents to see if it is more important the support on men than in women:  Parental support emerged as the most important factor for both boys and girls. This suggests that the encouragement and expectations that parents express to their children are more important predictors of children's self-efficacy and value beliefs than children's own computer activities.\\
\\
"The hypothesis that females develop positive computer beliefs when they begin to use computers but gradually lose their confidence and interest in computers because they are not sufficiently supported by their social environment may explain why very few female students end up choosing to study information technology when they finish secondary school or even drop out from computer science courses (Margolis \& Fisher, 2003)"}

  abstract = {Contending with negative intellectual stereotypes has been shown to depress the academic performance of targets of the stereotypes [Steele, C. M. (1997). A threat in the air: How stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance. American Psychologist, 52, 613--629]. The present paper examines whether women's mathematics performance is differentially affected by the concern of confirming that a negative stereotype is true of the self (self-threat), than by the concern of confirming that the stereotype is true of their gender (group-threat). In two studies we independently manipulated these different threats for women taking a mathematics test. Gender identification moderated the effect of group-threats on test performance; only women highly identified with their gender underperformed. The performance of less gender-identified women was unaffected by group-threats. In contrast, gender identification did not moderate the effect of self-threats---both high- and low-identified women underperformed. The results of these studies suggest that women's math performance is differentially affected by the source of the threat.},
