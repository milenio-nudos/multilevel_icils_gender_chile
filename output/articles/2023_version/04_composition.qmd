# School level. Composition effect theories (Gender and performance of classmates)

People’s social comparisons also affect their perceived self-efficacy. Based on social approaches to learning and performance, scholars have proposed that people can build or undermine their self-efficacy by vicarious experiences of observing others’ performances and proficiency. This occurs particularly in comparison to those who are perceived as having similar attributes, such as gender and age [@ahnNotSayUsing2020;@schunkPeerModelsChildren1987]. For instance, if individuals observe that their classmates did poorer than them, their self-efficacy will likely improve and vice versa. These social comparative factors in children’s performances are more influential in middle school, when young people are more aware of social comparative information [@ecclesGradeRelatedChangesSchool1984].

When considering classroom composition, it is crucial to understand that it encompasses various factors that can significantly influence the learning environment and student outcomes —such as digital self-efficacy. Classroom composition refers to a classroom's demographic, social, and academic makeup, including student attributes aggregated at the class level [@hochweberClassroomCompositionClassroom2014]. Research has shown that classroom composition can impact peer interactions, instructional behavior, and student achievement [@klusmannTeachersEmotionalExhaustion2016]. Additionally, classroom composition has been linked to developing antisocial behavior, motivation, language development, and executive function skills among students [@guoClassroomAgeComposition2014;@rjoskClassroomCompositionLanguage2015;@barnesEcologicalViewExecutive2023]. In this sense, changes in classroom composition, such as mixing students, can affect stability, peer interactions, and peer victimization within the classroom [@rambaranStabilityChangeStudent2020;@grahamPeerVictimizationSchool2006]. Furthermore, the distribution of student abilities within a classroom, known as heterogeneous grouping, has been associated with positive effects on academic achievement and social interactions [@rjoskClassroomCompositionLanguage2015].

The classroom composition, particularly in terms of gender balance, can significantly influence the acquisition and development of several skills among school-age children. For instance, @schneeweisGirlsGirlsGirls2012 reported that a higher share of girls in schools led to less likelihood of choosing female-dominated school types, whereas @alanGenderStereotypesClassroom2018 discovered that girls taught by teachers with traditional gender views had lower performance in math and verbal tests. In contrast, @tillmannIdentifyingExplainingGender2023 identified a positive relationship between scholastic achievement and the proportion of female students, suggesting that more girls in the classroom can lead to improved student behavior and academic potential. 

There are few studies that specifically assess the effects of gender composition on technological self-efficacy around educational contexts. At university level, @buschGenderGroupComposition1996 found that groups composed mostly of women tend to have more cooperative members than groups composed mostly of men to perform computational tasks related to management careers. However, women majority groups also have lower levels of computational self-efficacy, less previous experience with computers, and less previous encouragement to work with computers. At the secondary education level, through a multilevel exploration, @meelissenGenderDifferencesComputer2008 argue that gender disparities (in favor of boys) in the development of positive attitudes towards technologies are buffered to the extent that there is less presence of students promoting gender stereotypes and more female teachers teaching at school. In line with these findings, it would seem that as the level of female students increases, the students' self-efficacy levels in the school as a whole tend to decrease. However, if it is assumed that male students are the ones who mostly diffuse gender stereotypes with technologies, it could be hypothesized that as the number of female peers in the classroom increases, female students would feel more confident with their knowledge and skills with technologies.

Taking the previous arguments and evidence into account, the corresponding hypotheses are:
-   H4: A larger proportion of girls in the classroom increases girls’ self-efficacy. 
-   H5: Given gender stereotypes, girls will show lower self-efficacy than boys in classrooms with a higher average of computer literacy level.
