# Conclusions

Distinguishing between general and specialized self-efficacy is crucial in researching gender differences, as it allows for a more detailed understanding of how confidence in digital skills varies across different contexts. Our study reveals important gender differences in digital self-efficacy, offering valuable insights for educators and policymakers. Firstly, we observed that girls outperform boys in general self-efficacy, while boys exhibit higher specialized self-efficacy. This suggests a need for educational strategies that balance general and specialized skill development across genders, promoting a well-rounded digital competency.

Interestingly, we found that the average classroom performance in digital skills negatively impacts self-efficacy. This highlights the potential pressure students feel to meet high benchmarks, which can undermine confidence. To address this, educators should emphasize individual progress and a growth mindset, reducing the focus on peer comparisons and fostering a supportive learning environment. Another significant finding is that girls show higher specialized digital self-efficacy in schools with a larger male proportion, though general self-efficacy remains unaffected. This suggests that girls may strive to excel in specialized skills to assert their competence in male-dominated contexts. Creating collaborative, rather than competitive, learning environments can help girls develop confidence without feeling the pressure to prove themselves based on gender ratios. Contrary to our expectations, girls did not show lower self-efficacy than boys in high-achieving digital literacy environments. This indicates that equitable access to quality digital education benefits both genders, challenging stereotypes and promoting confidence in digital skills. This finding underscores the importance of providing high-quality digital literacy education universally.

Overall, our study highlights the complexity of gender dynamics in digital self-efficacy and emphasizes the importance of creating inclusive and supportive educational environments. However, our research has limitations, including a potential lack of diversity in the sample and the cross-sectional nature of the study, which limits the ability to draw causal inferences. Future research should explore longitudinal approaches and diverse populations to validate and expand upon these findings. Additionally, investigating specific educational practices and interventions that effectively promote equitable self-efficacy can provide actionable insights for educators aiming to support all students in developing the confidence and competence needed to thrive in the digital age.
