The hypotheses in this study made mostly reference to a general concept of self-efficacy, which is what is found in the literature in this field. Nevertheless, the contrast between general and specialized digital self-efficacy opened a series of opportunities as well as caveats in this research. The initial descriptive results reveal intriguing patterns: girls tend to outperform boys in general self-efficacy, while boys demonstrate higher levels of specialized self-efficacy. This disparity could suggest that girls possess a broader, more adaptable sense of confidence across various tasks and contexts, which might stem from a more holistic approach to learning and problem-solving. In contrast, boys’ higher specialized self-efficacy indicates stronger confidence in specific technical or digital skills, likely reflecting a more focused, skill-based learning strategy. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing and nurturing different types of self-efficacy in educational settings. Enhancing general self-efficacy in boys and specialized self-efficacy in girls could help bridge these gaps, fostering a more balanced skill set that supports both broad-based and specialized competencies in the digital age. 

Beginning with the individual hypotheses regarding self-efficacy, gender and performance at individual level, findings show a mixed picture. Better Computer and Information Literacy (CIL) performance positively affects general self-efficacy, but have a negative effect on specialized self-efficacy. That is, being more knowledgeable about different computer-related tasks seems to boost students’ self-confidence regarding basic tasks, but it also makes them insecure about more complex actions on computer or information technologies. Arguably, students with better performance are more aware of what they can and cannot do and, perhaps, more knowledgeable about their own limitations, which  hinders their belief in their abilities to achieve specific goals. 

Interestingly, and contrary to our expectations, gender effects on self-efficacy disappear when considering other predictors in our models. That is, while past research suggests girls tend to be less confident in their ability to to use ICTs than boys, in our case it is the overall school computer literacy what explains changes in self-efficacy.

Regarding the hypotheses that included school level variables, the finding that the average classroom performance in digital skills tests negatively affects self-efficacy adds an important dimension to our understanding of how educational environments influence students’ confidence. When students perceive that their peers perform well on digital skills tests, it may create a high benchmark that some students find daunting, potentially undermining their self-belief in their own abilities. This phenomenon can be particularly pronounced in students with lower initial confidence or those who struggle with digital skills, as the pressure to match or exceed the classroom average can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and discourage persistence. Conversely, a classroom environment where the average performance is moderate or low might alleviate some of this pressure, allowing students to build their skills and self-efficacy at their own pace.

One of the most puzzling results in this study is the finding that, contrary to our hypothesis (H4), girls exhibit higher specialized digital self-efficacy in schools with a larger male proportion, while general self-efficacy shows no gender differences. This could suggest that in environments where boys are more prevalent, girls may feel a greater impetus to excel in specialized digital skills, possibly to assert their competence and stand out in a male-dominated context. The competitive or comparative environment might drive girls to develop and showcase their expertise in specific digital domains, boosting their specialized self-efficacy. In contrast, the lack of gender differences in general self-efficacy in these schools indicates that overall confidence in handling a range of tasks and challenges remains unaffected by the gender composition of the student body. This could imply that general self-efficacy is more resilient to contextual factors such as the gender ratio and is influenced more by individual experiences and intrinsic motivations rather than external comparisons.

The expectation that girls would exhibit lower self-efficacy than boys in classrooms or schools with higher average scores on digital literacy was not supported by our findings, which showed no gender differences in either general or specialized self-efficacy under these conditions. This result challenges common assumptions about gender dynamics in high-achieving environments. One might speculate that in such contexts, the emphasis on digital literacy and skills is strong enough to provide equitable learning opportunities and resources for all students, thereby supporting both boys and girls equally. This unexpected finding may also indicate that girls are benefiting from the same high-quality instruction and access to digital tools as boys, allowing them to build confidence in their digital abilities regardless of the overall classroom performance. Additionally, it suggests that the supportive environment and perhaps the teaching methodologies employed in these high-achieving schools are effective in fostering self-efficacy among all students, irrespective of gender.
